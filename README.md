## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Two (Part one)💪🏾

There are two gymnastics teams. Reds and Blues. They compete agains each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the trophy

##### Your Task 😃:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
> **Data:**  Reds score 96, 108 and 89. Blues score 88, 91 and 110
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score)




Good Luck 😀
